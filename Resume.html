                                <h3>School before BYU</h3>
                                <p>I'm currently on a scholarship to study at BYU, originally i'm from Denmark and have lived there until i graduated Highschool. In middleschool i decided to attend boarding school which was one of the coolest experiences of my life. In my final year of Highschool i learned about BYU and the program that's running in my school where one student gets picked to go every year and in my grade, i was the lucky one to go.</p>
                                <br><h3>Work Experience</h3>
                                <p class="mb-0">I've previously worked in a few different restaurants as a cook as a freetime job during highschool, but never really anything that's actually related to my major. Right now i'm working on campus for BYU Food To Go, but i really want to get a internship, that's finance related in the near future. During highschool i also created my own company which was a super good learning experience for me, but eversince i've been on a visa in the US i haven't been able to keep it running. </p>
